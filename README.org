* Get started
** Software
   - openocd
   - gcc-arm-none-eabi
** CKS32 bluepill clone
   copy openocd files to:
   /usr/share/openocd/scripts/target/cs32f1x.cfg
   /usr/share/openocd/scripts/board/cs32f103c8t6.cfg

** Make and flash
   Connect st-link

   make -C my-project
   make flash -C my-project
** Debug
   start openocd:
   openocd -f /usr/share/openocd/scripts/board/cs32f103c8t6.cfg

   connect to it via gdb:
   gdb-multiarch --eval-command="target remote localhost:3333" my-project/your-file.elf

   You can also connect to openocd via 'telnet localhost 4444' and send some commands to it
